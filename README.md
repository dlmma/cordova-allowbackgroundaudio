What is it?
-------------------

This is a plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap which will allow for the playback of background audio or music to continue
without stopping whenever a media element occurs in your app.

This can be useful in case your users might listen to music or a podcast and your app has small transition sounds
or media content.

How to use
-------------------

This plugin provides a global object `AllowAudio` with the method `init`' which is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        AllowAudio.init();
    }
